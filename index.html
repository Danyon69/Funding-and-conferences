            <p>
                This site is a repository of opportunities related to travel, conferences, and funding specifically for biomechanics 
                and sports science postgrads. It's pretty hard to find these on your own, and even when you do, 
                there is no garuntee that they are legitimate. It also doesnt help that most online forums for conference 
                alerts are literal trash. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of the following have been checked for legitimacy, are well known and established, 
                and have either been awarded, or have run for, many years previously. Hopefully this 
                can save you weeks of searching for relevant conferences and funding.
            </p>
